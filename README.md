# Hanoi House Price Prediction Engine

  
This source code project is a Machine Learning/Data Science project that uses linear regression to predict actual house prices in **Hanoi**, the capital of Vietnam. This project will be updated continuously and as recently as possible according to our roadmap. Currently, the project's data is updated by the end of the third quarter of 2023 and the latest code version is updated on **December 16, 2023**.


## Project Purpose

The project is researched by a group of research students at **FPT University (Hanoi Campus)**, to be able to provide users with reference information about the price of a house in Hanoi according to criteria such as address, area area, length of the house,... so customers can have a more objective view. The project completely uses the **Linear Regression** algorithm.

## Files and folders

In order to maximize user convenience, the project developer will explain each file and folder in detail. The files will be used almost entirely on the **Jupyter Notebook** platform, which will help users change the data themselves and use prediction algorithms easily.

Currently, the project has the following files and folders:
- [house-price-prediction.ipynb](house-price-prediction.ipynb) : this is the official source code file written on Jupyter Notebook. In this file is the engine of the entire model, including visualizing data, training and calculating model performance. Currently, the model has an **efficiency of about 72%**. In this project, we use **Python 3.10.9** and Scikit-learn library.
  
- [house_price_data.csv](house_price_data.csv) : this is a CSV file containing data of more than 5,000 houses in Hanoi, the results of this investigation have been carefully surveyed by the project team for half a year. early 2023. Of course, the data in the csv file above has been completely preprocessed, removing noise and only retaining the best data for the problem. This data is open source, unpublished and highly reliable, perfectly suitable for other Data or Machine Learning projects.
