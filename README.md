# Hanoi House Price Prediction Engine

  
This source code project is a machine learning/data science project that uses linear regression to predict actual house prices in **Hanoi**, the capital of Vietnam. This project will be updated continuously and as recently as possible according to our roadmap. Currently, the project's data is updated by the end of the third quarter of 2023 and the latest code version is updated on **December 16, 2023**.


## Project Purpose

The project is researched by a group of research students at **FPT University (Hanoi Campus)**, to be able to provide users with reference information about the price of a house in Hanoi according to criteria such as address, area area, length of the house,... so customers can have a more objective view. The project completely uses the **Linear Regression** algorithm.

## Files and folders

In order to maximize user convenience, the project developer will explain each file and folder in detail. The files will be used almost entirely on the **Jupyter Notebook** platform, which will help users change the data themselves and use prediction algorithms easily.
